LINUX began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvals:
to create a new free operating system kernel. The resulting LINUX kernel h
as been marked by constant growth throughout its history. Since the initial
release of its source code in 1991,  has grown from a small number of  C
 files under a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4.15
 version in 2018 with more than 23.3 million lines of source code, not
 counting comments, under the GNU General Public License v2

After AT&K had dropper out of the Multics project, the Unix operating
 system was conceived and implemented by KEn Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
 (both of AT&T Bell Laboratories) in 1969 and first releasd in 1970. Later
they rewrote  in a new programming language, C, to make  portable.
